Life is an Adventure
by Byron Rogers

For many years as a teen I couldn't remember my childhood, but slowly it all came back to me.  I had an amazing childhood, althought it didn't start out that way.

One of my first memories was my mom dropping me off to stay with my uncles.  They were very pecular.  They really enjoyed running off visitors who tried to sell them everything under the sun.  Sometimes they even shot at them.  They didn't mean any harm.  They just enjoyed scaring folks.  Rumor was they were rich, so salesmen kept coming.

I remember once I talked them into buying some seeds from a salesman.  We all worked hard planting and weeding the garden for months, hoping for a grand harvest of potatoes, tomatoes, greens, cucumbers, melons, corn, and ocra.  You can imagine the shock when the crops came up and all we had was corn as far as the eye could see.  The salesman really got the best of us that time.  Another time we bought a skeet shooter and even an old lion retired from the circus.  The adventures we had!!

My mom came back for me a few years later, with her boyfriend dujoir.  She tried to get me to leave with her, while her knight in shining armour tried to find the rumored wealth of my uncles.  That didn't go as planned.  Joe Cool wound up get attacked by our pet lion, and I talked my mom into doingG something for ME for once in my life.  She let me stay.  I had really grown to love my uncles Hub and Garth.  They had become great role models for me.

Once I grew up, went to college and got a writing job, I got the call we all fear.  It was the local sherrif telling me my uncles had died.  He wouldn't tell me any more.  He just told me I had to come and see.  When I arrived he took me to them.  Apparently they had bought and old plane and flew it into the barn upside down, which killed them.  I had to laugh.  The died as they had lived, holding nothing back.  Living the adventure.S  I had to laugh a little.  What a great family.

Now that I think about it, that wasn't what happend at all, at least not to me.  That was a movie.  It is one of my favorite movies.  So if you want to know more about Hub and Garth and all the hillarious adventures they had and feel really good once the story ends, be sure to see Secondhand Lions.  I hope you enjoyed the story.
